# PyCalculator

The application is a tool for performing basic arithmetic operations. 

The user has 4 operations to choose. 
MENU:

1 - Addition

4 - Division

To run the application: python3 name_of_the_file.py

If youâ€™re using PyCharm IDE, you can simply press ctrl+shift+F10 to run unittest module. Otherwise you can use command prompt to run this module. For example, we named the file for unit-testing as Basic_Test.py. So the command to run python unittest will be:
$python3.6 -m unittest Basic_Test.Testing

If you want to see the verbose, then the command will be:
$python3.6 -m unittest -v Basic_Test.Testing
